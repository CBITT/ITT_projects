## Car directory system with CouchDB

Implementation of CouchDB database with the usage of REST interface to show examples of CRUD and calls to a mapreduce operations. The app is built on the hybrid application framework Ionic. Ionic is powered with Cordova and provides functionality to Angular. For the connection to CouchDB, I created a local
database PouchDB that serves as a driver for CouchDB. PouchDB is the JavaScript database that syncs.
